# Titanic-Shipwrek-Project-Using-Ml
The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based off a set of data. We used Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to retrieve necessary data and evaluate
accuracy of our predictions. The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome (whether or not a passenger survived). We used this set to build our model to
generate predictions for the test set. For each passenger in the test set, we had to predict whether or not they survived
the sinking. Our score was the percentage of correctly predictions. In our work, we learned
 Programming language Python and its libraries NumPy (to perform matrix operations) and SciKit-Learn (to apply machine learning algorithms)
 Several machine learning algorithms (decision tree, random forests, extra trees, linear regression)
 Feature Engineering techniques
